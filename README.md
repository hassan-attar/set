# Hashing Set

Hashing Set is a C++ template-based library that provides a set data structure implementation using various hashing techniques. It supports open addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing) and separate chaining for collision resolution (utilizing [SkipList](https://github.com/hassan-attar/skiplist) as chains).

## Features

- Templated set data structure implementation.
- Support for different probing methods: linear, quadratic, double hashing, and chaining.
- Dynamic resizing of the hash table.
- Efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

## Usage
To use Hashing Set in your project, simply include the `Set.h` header file. you don't need to compile the `Set.tpp` file.
